Legend Mod is provided free of charge by Legend Clan.
Development of Legend Mod is due to:
1. Donations
2. Players of Legend Clan - https://legendclan.joomla.com/ . They supported me very much, thanks a lot!

Thus, people who use ℄ Symbol on their name, enjoy the Priviledges of:

1. * Sending Message Script Commands, without using Password or being in Game (before clicking Play).
2. ** Can send me message to Skype (My Skype Id: jimboy3100) of the animated skin of their choice (2nd Tab - Profiles), so everyone can see their skin animated.

* These commands have restrictions of (A. being in Game B. Using Password) to avoid game spamming.
** The function does not permit me to use variables, but only Strings by using the w.core.registerSkin command (I cannot release the function for other modders not to copy, :-D )

***Anchors reference to this link show up on Legend when using ℄ on game name.
